This game is a hobby of mine to hack upon when I have idle time. The head of
the source will usually compile, but not all features of the game might be
working. When I feel that a real feature set of the game is working and
playable, I'll tag it as a release.

The internals of the game is moderately complex. This is because I
have a list of features I want to add that have complex intersection
in the code. I'll eventually get them out of my notebook and into a
TODO file here. Currently, I'm working more on the engine and sumulationist
aspects of the engine as opposed to the game mechanics themselves. Once I get
enough pieces that I think a lot of fun can be had, I will inflate the game
with content and actual game mechanics.

If people find it interesting to hack in here, I'll glady accept
patches and such.

Thank you.

Peter Keller
